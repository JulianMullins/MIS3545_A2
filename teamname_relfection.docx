In terms of our teamâ€™s process, we did a solid job of collaboration, making sure to meet up as a group each time we worked. This helped us to easily bounce ideas off of each other in real-time and to divide up the work fairly. We began by designing our relational database for a fictitious Lemonade Stand company, making sure to think through all the tables we would need as well as all our assumptions (only one employee per stand, for example). Although we chose to use a lemonade stand for this project due to its simplicity, the project scope nevertheless became larger than we had expected. For example, we had to accommodate having ten distinct products rather than the initial one (original lemonade) that we had planned on.

We ran into various stumbling blocks along the way. For one of these, our team decided to collaborate using Google Docs so that we could all be on the same document at once; however when it came time to transfer this content to a sql document we ran into syntax errors related to the way in which Visual Studio translated the pasted text content.. We had to use the control + F function to replace all our apostrophes, for example. We also had to do search for answers on how to properly insert and format dates in sql.
